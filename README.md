   * <ins>Reliability</ins> 
     * The system should work correctly and provide the expected performance under expected load.
     * The reliable system should cover all the below points.
       1. The application performs the function that the user expected.
       2. It can tolerate the user making mistakes or using the software in unexpected
         ways.
       3. Its performance is good enough for the required use case, under the expected.
         load and data volume.
       4. The system prevents any unauthorized access and abuse.
       
   * <ins>System Failures</ins>
     * Hardware Faults: 
       * Examples: Disk, RAM, CPU, Network Cable.
       * Solution: Add redundancy to the individual hardware components in order to reduce the failure rate of the system, but This approach cannot completely prevent hardware problems
         from causing failures.
     * Software Errors:
       * Examples: Software bug, Running process that use up the shared resources like CPU, memory, disk space, or bandwidth.
       * Solution: There is no quick solution, measuring, monitoring, and analyzing system behavior can help.
     * Human Errors:
     
   * <ins>Scalability</ins>
